### Modelling Past and Future Impacts of Droughts on Tree Mortality and Carbon Storage in Norway Spruce Stands in Germany

## Summary
Central Europe faced severe droughts between 2018 and 2020, causing unprecedented Norway spruce mortality, which existing dynamic vegetation models (DVMs) failed to reproduce. To address this, logistic regression models were developed using climate anomalies and mortality data from German forest monitoring plots and integrated into the DVM LPJ-GUESS. These models accurately captured historical mortality patterns (1998-2020) but showed variability in predicting future events (2021-2070) under RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 scenarios. Simulations indicated significant biomass and carbon storage losses, highlighting the urgent need to consider drought-induced mortality in predictive studies, despite uncertainties in event timing and magnitude.
