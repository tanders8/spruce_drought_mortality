# Modelling past and future drought impacts on Norway spruce forests in Germany

## Abstract

Between 2018 and 2020, Central Europe experienced a series of severe and prolonged drought events that put considerable strain on forest ecosystems. Notably, German Norway spruce (Picea abies) experienced an unprecedented increase in tree mortality rates, which has not been reproduced in process-based forest or dynamic vegetation models (DVMs). In this study, we developed statistical logistic regression models for weather-related Norway spruce mortality using mortality data from the forest monitoring plot network of the German crown condition survey and incorporated them into the widely used DVM LPJ-GUESS. Under historical climatic conditions (1998-2020), our simulations successfully replicated general temporal and spatial patterns of observed spruce tree mortality. Future simulations (2021-2070) under the RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 greenhouse gas concentration scenarios show periodic increases in spruce mortality of similar or, under RCP8.5, higher mortality rates than in the recent past. We demonstrate that considering drought-related mortality is a critical component to fully capture climate change effects on spruce forests. For instance, simulations with the additional drought mortality imply marked reductions in spruce forest biomass stocks (e.g. -18% in RCP2.6 and -36% in RCP8.5 in 2070 (mean across all simulations)) compared to baseline simulations without drought mortality. Furthermore, results indicate potential harvest losses due to drought-related reduction in Germany, which could accumulate to 310 million tC (RCP2.6) and 447 million tC (RCP 8.5) in the period from 2021 to 2070 (mean across all simulations). However, predictions differ depending on the underlying climate scenario and the statistical model used. Our findings underscore the severe risk of further spruce forest diebacks in the future, strongly affecting forest ecosystem services and highlight the need for further drought-mortality developments in vegetation models.
